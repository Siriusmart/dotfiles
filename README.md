## Basic description

- This is my daily driver, running Arch with Hyprland + Waybar.
- Idles (after boot) with ~500MB memory usage, and 0% CPU like any systems should.
- Mainly Nord, but also include darker colours I made up which are not part of the Nord palette.

Here's everything that has been modified:

### btop++

- Removed forced background to respect terminal theme, that's it.

### Cava

- Increased smoothening and fps to 75 (my monitor refresh rate).
- Disabled auto sensitivity.

### Coc.nvim

- Includes a list of coc.nvim extensions I use in `extensions/package.json`.
- Coc will probably auto download the actual code of the extensions since they are not there.

### Dwarf fortress
